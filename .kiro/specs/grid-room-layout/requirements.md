# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current room-based dungeon exploration system into a grid-based layout where rooms are arranged in a coordinate system. Rooms will connect through exits that align with adjacent discovered rooms, creating a cohesive dungeon map. Players can navigate between rooms by clicking on exits, provided they meet the adjacency requirement of having an X (crossed square) orthogonally adjacent to the exit.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want rooms to be arranged in a predictable grid layout, so that I can understand the spatial relationship between discovered rooms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new room is generated THEN the system SHALL assign it grid coordinates (x, y)
2. WHEN displaying multiple rooms THEN the system SHALL position them according to their grid coordinates
3. WHEN a room is created through an exit THEN the system SHALL place it at the appropriate adjacent grid position
4. IF a room already exists at target coordinates THEN the system SHALL connect to the existing room instead of creating a new one

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want room exits to automatically connect to adjacent rooms when they are discovered, so that the dungeon feels like a connected space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a room has an exit on the north wall THEN it SHALL connect to the room at coordinates (x, y+1) if discovered
2. WHEN a room has an exit on the south wall THEN it SHALL connect to the room at coordinates (x, y-1) if discovered
3. WHEN a room has an exit on the east wall THEN it SHALL connect to the room at coordinates (x+1, y) if discovered
4. WHEN a room has an exit on the west wall THEN it SHALL connect to the room at coordinates (x-1, y) if discovered
5. WHEN two adjacent rooms both have exits facing each other THEN they SHALL be visually connected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to click on any room's exit to navigate there, so that I have freedom to explore the dungeon without being restricted to my current room.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on any visible room exit THEN the system SHALL allow navigation if requirements are met
2. WHEN I click on an exit THEN the system SHALL not require me to be in that specific room
4. IF the target room doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL generate it at the appropriate grid coordinates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want exit navigation to require strategic positioning, so that there is meaningful gameplay around room traversal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a room exit THEN the system SHALL only allow navigation if I have an X orthogonally adjacent to that exit
2. WHEN checking adjacency THEN the system SHALL consider squares directly north, south, east, or west of the exit
3. WHEN checking adjacency THEN the system SHALL not consider diagonally adjacent squares
4. IF no X is orthogonally adjacent to the clicked exit THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and provide feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the grid layout to be visually clear and intuitive, so that I can easily understand the dungeon structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple rooms are displayed THEN they SHALL be arranged with consistent spacing based on grid coordinates
2. WHEN rooms are connected THEN the connection SHALL be visually apparent through aligned exits
3. WHEN viewing the dungeon map THEN empty grid spaces SHALL be clearly distinguishable from undiscovered rooms
4. WHEN a new room is discovered THEN it SHALL appear in the correct grid position relative to existing rooms
5. All rooms should take up the same amount of vertical and horizontal space, regardless of how many squares the room contains

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a multiplayer participant, I want the grid-based room system to work seamlessly with real-time synchronization, so that all players see the same dungeon layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any player discovers a new room THEN all players SHALL see it appear at the same grid coordinates
2. WHEN any player navigates through an exit THEN all players SHALL see the updated player position
3. WHEN room connections are established THEN they SHALL be synchronized across all clients
4. WHEN the dungeon grid is modified THEN the changes SHALL be immediately visible to all connected players
